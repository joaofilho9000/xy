Analytical and computational study of classical XY model

The effects of impurities on the critical behavior of
magnetic systems have been extensively investigated in
both theoretical and experimental points of view . The main reason
resides on the fact that experiments on phase transitions
in magnetic materials are usually subject to randomly
distributed impurities. The principal aim of these stud-
ies is not only to understand the effects of these impu-
rities in the thermodynamic behavior of the system, but
also to know how the disorder changes the character of
the phase transition and therefore its universality class.
To emphasize this effect, in some experiments magnetic
materials are doped with non-magnetic impurities. Sometimes
the time scale of the mobility of these impurities is much
smaller than the typical time scale of spin the fluctua-
tions. In this case, one can resort to an approximation
by modeling the disorder effects in a completely frozen
state. This is the so-called quenched approximation. The
other limit, which is opposite to the quenched system, is
called annealed disorder, and refers to the case where the
two relevant time scales are of the same order.
      On the other hand, the classical XY model is also of
great interest, both as the simplest statistical model with
continuous degrees of freedom, and as a model for the
phase transition in non-magnetic systems, such as su-
perfluid 4 He and 3 He- 4 He mixtures[5–7], among others.
Recent analytical approaches [8], and Monte Carlo (MC)
simulations [9–11], have analyzed the effect of quenched
non-magnetic impurities on the properties of the two-
dimensional XY model and the results agree with pre-
vious ones in the literature[12] regarding the Berezinski-
Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. MC simulations and an-
alytical approximations are, however, less ubiquitous for
the three-dimensional version of the diluted XY model.
